# [WizWeather](https://wizweather.herokuapp.com/)

WizWeather is a weather data app which is making use of OpenWeatherMap API under the hood. It has bene made purely with React with TypeScript.

By using interfaces and models the application is strongly types making it very easy to catch the errors, beauty of TypeScript.

For charting purposes I used ChartJS and react-chart-2 an infamous library for visualizing data. Sass has been used in the project as a choice of pre processor.

Webpack takes care of all the bundling and other necessary build tasks.

## What can I do with the app?

You can see real time weather of 4 cities. On selecting a city you can also see the forecast for next 16 days with 3 hours interval. You can see indicators like temperature, mood, humidity and more.

You can also see a line chart with temperature and humidity of upcoming weather condition of all the cities.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies by running `npm i`.
For running development build on localhost please run `npm run build-dev`.
Head to `localhost:8080` to witness the magic.
